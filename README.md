## Before starting...

In order to use coinbase rates API, i had to use chrome extension (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf) so you might need to do the same in order for everything to work properly.

Be sure to use `npm i` to install all the necessary packages.

## After all packages have been installed

Use `npm start` to launch the project.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
